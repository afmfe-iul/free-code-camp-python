GIL: Global interpreter lock
- A lock that allows only one thread at a time to execute in Python

- Needed in CPython because memory management is not thread-safe

- Avoid the GIL limitations by using:
    - multiprocessing
    - a different, free-threaded Python implementation (Jython, IronPython)
    - Python as a wrapper for third-party libraries (C/C++) -> numpy, scipy
