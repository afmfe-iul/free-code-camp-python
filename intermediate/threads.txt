Thread: An entity within a process that can be scheduled (also known as "lightweight process"). A process can spawn multiple threads.

+ All threads within a process share the same memory
+ Lightweight
+ Starting a thread is faster than starting a process
+ Great for I/O-bound tasks

- Threading is limited by GIL (Global Interpreter Lock): only one thread at a time
- No effect for CPU-bound tasks
- Can't be interrupted/killed
- Race conditions can occur
